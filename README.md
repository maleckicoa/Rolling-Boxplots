# Rolling-Boxplots

Python code for making boxplots in a rolling timeframe.
The script is made for Jupiter notebook, which allows for dynamic visual output.
An example table "boxplot_example_value.xls" with dummy data is attached.

The code is written against the following columns/parameters of the example table:

instrument='product'
transtatus='C'
ba1='B'
ba2='A'
Q='VOLUME'

The code can easily be changed to fit any table, and plot any subset of the column chosen by the user.
